# configuration-files readme

## Outline
This folder is a draft of a location to store configuration files used to generate UCLH synthetic data. The software datafaker/sqlsynthgen can create initial versions of these config files by looking at a data extract. These initial versions of the config files contain the names of the tables and columns in the data extract. The files can then be modified through an interactive process where the user can choose how to populate the tables and columns in the synthetic data to be created.

## Folder structure
This folder can contain folders for templates and projects.
